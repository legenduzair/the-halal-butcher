## Project Overview

The Halal Butcher is a full-stack Django website built using Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This web application is a full B2C e-commerce website for a fictional online Halal meat supplier based in the North West of England. The Halal Butcher specialises in selling and delivering the finest quality of meats such as beef, chicken, lamb, sheep & more to users who want to enjoy these cuts with their family and friends. The site provides users with different functionalities that eases the process of purchasing a product. Users of the site can browse all products, filter products by diverse categories and also search for specific products by keyword search. From the list of products, users can select them to display each product in detail, giving users the option to add the product to their basket or return to the product list page to browse other meats. Users are also able to view the website blog to view all the latest & updated information on on The Halal Butcher. Registered users can add the product to their wishlist or a leave a review for other users to view. Authenticated users can also checkout securely inputting their personal & payment details to purchase the product and also store these details on their profile for easier future purchases. On the other hand, The Halal Butcher provides the store owner with functionalities such as product management (add, edit & delete products) without accessing the admin interface and blog post management (add, edit & delete blogs).

This website application includes CRUD functionality, user authentication (using Django's allauth library), email validation and database interaction.

### The Scope Plane

#### Entity Relationship Diagram

As this project utilises Django which is a MVT(Model, View & Template) framework, a connection to database tables or 'Models' is required. An entity relationship diagram was created to visually map out the structure of the databases & models. The entity relationship diagram was creating using [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) and is shown below:
